//// Game Design
 
Introduction
The goal of this game is to get the same picture twice in a row before your friends beat you to it!

Abstract
Start the game with the word of your choice, and see what Flickr feels best represents it!  The next word you (or your friends!) input is the first word that comes to mind upon seeing the image.  If the image you get for this second word matches the first, YOU WIN!  (Writing the same word twice is cheating! So don't cheat, you cheating cheater, you!)

Target Audience
ALL OF YOUR BESTEST FRIENDS

Platform
Web, Mobile

Unique Selling Points
*Being based upon Flickr's tagging system, this game works in all languages supported by Flickr!  (AKA, SO MANY LANGUAGES!)
*The game utilized NowJS's unique multi-threading capabilities, so multiple friends can play together at once.

Game Mechanics
Choose a username (or be supplied one at random), enter a word, and attempt to guess the other tags associated with the image.

Controls
Textbox!  Keepin' it old school.

Scoring
Points are awarded for each tag you guess that yields the previous image.

Win Conditions
Generate the same photo twice with two separate words by guessing multiple tags on the image, based on its content.

Lose Conditions
Don't win.

Level Design
Speed is the name of the game!  Guess the tags before your friends can.  

Story
Free association is fun. Everyone sees images differently, and recalls different memories after seeing them. try to guess what people were thinking when posting their photos.

Players
Anyone with access to the game.  

Visual Style
Plain and simple, mobile and browser accessible.
